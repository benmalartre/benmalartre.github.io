Furax is a set of ICE compound for grooming hairs from polygon surface and volume.
Furax was originaly develloped at Ellipsanime Studio and used on the TV series The Linkers and Boulle & Bill.
It s composed of four objects: a polymesh emitter, a polymesh cage, a guide point cloud and a render point cloud.
In the end only the render point cloud is used at rendering stage.
We animate the hairs via simulation and/or rigging of the cage object.
It s a solid but not accurate framework for animation of hairs , as they will be move per packet instead of per fiber.
